dont create unnecsary .md files, and make sure all comments in codebase are in lower case for all projcts

DO NOT EVER HARD CODE ANY SENSITIVE DATAACROSS ALL PROGRAMMING AND SCRIPTING LANGUAGES

write code like a senior engineer. always optmize for qyality and code speed

no readme with steps of tasks to be created, no unneccasry files.

all comments in lower case ACROSS all programming and scripting languages

no unneccsarry comments, keep them less verbose

NO EMOJIS

always favor SOLID principles of code writing

any .md file you create in the process of solving a problem should be created in the /temp of this .cursor directory
and should be deleted after that solution is deemed done by the user

ALWAYS PRIORITISE SECURITY

ALWAYS MAKE SURE ALL SENSITIVE DATA ARE IGNORE BY GIT

always clean up code and remove redundant files, duplicate implementations and unneccsary files

always keep code clean  with not too much comments

stop retaining your setup.md files. even if you create them delete them immediately. or dont create at all

all console statements should be in lower case

FOR HEYSAVI
Only apply this configuration in the if i am working in the hey-savi repository which is at /Users/opeyemibabalola/Desktop/Workspace/hey-savi

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript, JS, MJS, Terraform, Bash Scipts

- Strict type checking enabled
- use best coding standards across all languages
- no comments, and where necessay, use very minimal

### ESLint Rules

- **Code Quality**: No unused variables, consistent returns
- **Performance**: Max 100 lines per function
- **Security**: No console.log in production, no debugger, make sure all console statements are for info or error


## File Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Lower Case, with _ to seperate words
- **Utilities**: lower (`formatDate.ts`)
- **Types**: PascalCase (`User.ts`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_ENDPOINTS.ts`)

## Import Patterns

- **Absolute Imports**: Use `@/` alias for src directory
- **Type Imports**: Always use `import type` for types
- **Relative Imports**: Only for same-directory files
- **External Libraries**: Grouped and alphabetized

## Error Handling

- **API Errors**: Centralized error processing with logging
- **Global Error Listener**: Application-wide error handling
- **User Feedback**: Graceful error messages

## Performance Considerations
- ** Make sure every code line is optimized, with the best time-space complexity
- ** Use best practices for code optimization, and also new features of a language

## Best Practices

- **Minimal Comments**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Performance**: Optimize for Core and Best speed and quality
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines
- **Security**: Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
